## Carl Linus Mjörnstedt
A friendly, bright and hardworking individual who works great as part of a team. Outgoing and determined, enjoys being challenged, and is always happy to hear constructive criticism. I am very comfortable speaking in front of people and have excellent interpersonal skills.
 When working with others, I strive towards cohesive, efficient, and collaborative teamwork. Learning to programme with no previous knowledge has given me complete confidence that I can quickly pick-up any language or skill given the chance.
 I easily adapt to new environments and wholeheartedly believe I will be an asset to any team I join.

## Soft Skills

#### Excellent Interpersonal Skills

I am approachable, friendly, and trustworthy. During my time at Makers, many of my fellow students approached me when they encountered problems, be it with their code or something more personal.
Working as a property manager, I was the first contact for landlords, tenants and contractors. Thus, I had to develop different processes for communicating and working with individuals in different roles and from diverse backgrounds.


#### Creativity and Problem-Solving

When programming, I heavily rely on my problem-solving skills. I find that following my usual methodical approach helps me decipher error messages and iron out bugs. My creative mind is also a huge help. During my time at Makers, I was known for coming up with innovative ideas for app features.

#### Organisation and Time Management

While working for Veeve, my manager gave me complete autonomy to manage my own work. I organised my own schedule, booking in visits to properties all over London whilst making sure I also had the time to complete the required paperwork and handle any maintenance issues.


#### Public Speaking 
Whilst at Makers, I always volunteered to present our group projects to the cohort. I enjoyed gaining an in-depth knowledge of every part of the projects and relaying them to the audience.
