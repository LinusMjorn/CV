## Carl Linus Mj√∂rnstedt

A friendly, bright and hardworking individual who works great as part of a team; outgoing and determined,
enjoys being challenged, and is always happy to hear constructive criticism.

I have spent the last year working in the property industry,
starting with managing student housing and finishing my career in 2020
working for a high end boutique estate agents in Notting Hill.

The tech industry excites me because of the many different solutions to challenges,
 which allows me to be creative in my approach to problem solving.

## Experience

**Mountgrange Heritage** (Oct-19 to Aug-20)  
_Property Manager_

- As I became increasingly interested in programming during this time,
I tried to find challenges similar to coding wherever I could. For example,
I automated parts of my team's tasks by creating complex spreadsheets in Excel.

**Veeve** (Jul-17 to Apr-19)  
_Property Manager_

- Veeve is a company specialising in short term holiday lets,
with an active in-house development team coming up with a variety of tech solutions.
I worked with the development team to create a specifically designed app to facilitate property inspections.

## Skills

#### Great interpersonal skills

Working as a property manager, I was the first contact for landlords, tenants and contractors.
Thus, I had to develop different processes for communicating and working
with individuals in different roles and from diverse backgrounds.

#### Creativity and Problem-Solving

In 2018, I started playing Dungeons and Dragons, mainly as the Dungeon Master.
I spent countless hours crafting characters, encounters,
and locations for my party to explore, only for them to do something completely unpredictable,
thus having to improvise and use my problem-solving skills to remedy the damage done.

#### Organisation and Time Management

While working for Veeve, my manager gave me complete autonomy to manage my own work.
I organised my own schedule, booking in visits to properties all over London whilst making
sure I also had the time to complete the necessary paper work and handle any maintenance issues.


## Education

- OOP, TDD, MVC, DDD

- RSpec, Jasmine

#### Northumbria University (2012 - 2014)

## Hobbies

Cooking is one of my passions. I love spending whole days in the kitchen with friends,
experimenting and creating new dishes.
Running is another hobby of mine; I find it very beneficial for my mental and physical well-being to head out for an hour,
get my heart pumping, and clear my head.
